# Platform spoofer

Firefox add-on to fake `navigator.platform`.

When settings are changed, updates all pages without reloading.

Does nothing else. If you want to control more properties, use a general privacy suite, not this.

## Install

[Get Platform spoofer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/platform-spoofer/) on the Firefox add-ons website.
